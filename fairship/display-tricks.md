# Display tricks

Check the guide of TEve for more details

SHiPDisplay.NextEvent(ievent)

## Background details

* e button: put in white or in black background
* w button: put wireframe

Set transparent with SHiPDisplay.transparentMode('on')

## Movement

Use the mouse, not the keyboard (with ssh it lags way worse than an high ping mobile online game):

* middle mouse button for movement
* middle mouse scrool for zoom in/out
* Use ctrl and shift to increase/decrease movement precision
