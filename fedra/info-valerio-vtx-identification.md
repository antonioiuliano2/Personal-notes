# Info Valerio Vtx Identification

Script name: Definitions.h 

Description: Header file where simulation and vertex variables and trees are declared.
	     The name of the simulation files needs to be set here.

Script name: vtx_MC_analysis.C 

Description: Code for the identification of vertices reconstructed by FEDRA using a MC simulation.

	     The code provides most probable event and mother ID for each vertex, the number of 
	     electrons, primaries and charm daughters. A flag, charm_daug tells about the presence
   	     of a charm daughter in a vertex.

	     It requires as input file the vertex file usually called "vertextree_test.root" and 
	     a simulation file.
	     
	     It provides in output the file called "vtx_MC_analysis.root" that is used as input for
	     the BDTs studies (see README_BDT.txt).


List of variables:

	1) mp_eventID  --> Most probable montecarlo id of the vertex
	
	2) mp_motherID  --> Most probable montecarlo mother id of the vertex
	
	3) mp_pdgID  --> Most probable pdg id of the vertex
	
	4) charm_daug  --> If 0 no charm daughter tracks in the vertex, if 1 a least one charm daughter in the vertex
	
	5) n_electrons  --> Number of electrons in the vertex (even if the montecarlo id is different from mp_eventID)
	
	6) n_primaries  --> Number of primary daughter tracks (mother id of the track is -1)
	
	7) n_charmdaug  --> Number of charm daughter tracks (mother id of the track is 1 or 2)
	
	8) n_events --> Number of montecarlo events linked to the vertex (ideal case == 1)	
	
	9) n_mothers --> Number of mother IDs linked to the vertex (ideal case == 1)
