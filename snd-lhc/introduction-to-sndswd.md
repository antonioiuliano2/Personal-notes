# Introduction to sndsw

## 

sndsw is the software repository of the new project SND@LHC. It follows the same software framework of FairShip, so all details can be checked in the FairShip pages. Here, I will report the instructions for these specific simulations

The repository is hosted on GitHub, at the following link

{% embed url="https://github.com/SND-LHC/sndsw/tree/master" %}

I will refer to this folder as **$SNDSW** in all this documentation.
