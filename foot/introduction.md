# Introduction

A Drive document in our group Istruzioni Ricostruzione FOOT contains a practical reminder of all commands and operations (in Italian). Remember to read it often!

## Environments

We perform reconstruction in FOOT in nusrv9.na.infn.it. The environments are

* source \~/source\_valeri.sh for almost all operations
* source foot/fedrafoot/setup\_new.sh
